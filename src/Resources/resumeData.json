      "bio": " Jonas Ward is an explorer of patterns, both conceptually and aesthetically. His work primarily deals with generating analysis and design tools using ongoing developments in the realm of computer science and additive manufacturing, to help us find purpose and solutions for “the baggage of the past”. Because of the strong focus on contextualisation ecology, history and cultural heritage are often recurring themes. Design is not only creating but also re-using. Because of this Jonas also works with UGD on developing various analysis tools finding the qualities in the built environment and on generative design tools to find solutions to improve existing deficits with minimal effort.",
